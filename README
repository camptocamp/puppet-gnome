This module allows basic gnome configuration for user environments.

GConf is the older Gnome configuration system (shipped <= Ubuntu Lucid) and
GSettings is the newer equivalent.

In current Gnome versions(11/2011), the migration of application between GConf
and GSettings in progress, so both systems may be used depending on the
application you want to configure.
