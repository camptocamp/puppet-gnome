#puppet-gnome
Basic puppet-drive gnome configuration for user environments

##gconf or gsettings?
GConf is the older Gnome configuration system (shipped `<= Ubuntu Lucid) and
GSettings is the newer equivalent.

In current Gnome versions(11/2011), the migration of application between GConf
and GSettings in progress, so both systems may be used depending on the
application you want to configure.

##Example
The following example sets the user's Window Manager **theme** preference
to be 'Ambiance'
```
gnome::gsettings { "wmpref":
  user => "user",
  schema => "org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences",
  key => "theme",
  value => "Ambiance",
}
```
